Installation and running:

mvn clean package
java -jar target/cybersecuritybase-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Open the browser in the URL http://localhost:8080

The accounts and passwords are:
-one/yksi
-two/kaksi


FLAW 1:

Description

A2:2017 Broken Authentication

The application exposes the session ID (jsessionid) in the URL.

When the user opens the new browser (and other browser windows are not open) and enters the URL 

http://localhost:8080 

the browser goes to the URL where the session ID is exposed, like this:

http://localhost:8080/login;jsessionid=A00E5471120F09D9FA3FA69D5EE3A50D

Note: 

The flaw has reproduced with the following operating system and browser combinations:

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS + Firefox 70.0.1
Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 10.0.18362 + Firefox 71.0 (64-bittinen)
Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 10.0.18362 + Chrome 79.0.3945.88 (Official Build) (32-bit)

The flaw has NOT reproduced with the following operating system browser combination:

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS + Chrome  72.0.3626.121

How to fix it

Remove the line 

http.sessionManagement().enableSessionUrlRewriting(true);

in the method sec.project.config.SecurityConfiguration.configure. After the fix the jsessionid parameter is not exposed in the URL.


FLAW 2:

Description

A6:2017 Security Misconfiguration

The Spring security's default CSRF protection is disabled.

How to fix it

Remove the line 

http.csrf().disable();

in the method sec.project.config.SecurityConfiguration.configure.

After the fix the forms (http://localhost:8080/login and http://localhost:8080/form) which the application returns
contain automatically the hidden input field _csrf like this:

<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="a28a4b3d-b1cc-450e-9bef-6bde213d5cc6" />

when the form in posted the hidden field

_csrf: a28a4b3d-b1cc-450e-9bef-6bde213d5cc6

is posted also to the server with the other form parameters.


FLAW 3:

Description

A3:2017 Sensitive Data Exposure

The application saves the social security number in the plain text format.

How to fix it

In the method sec.project.controller.SignupController.submitForm use the commands:

TextEncryptor encryptor = Encryptors.delux("kddskRdls!klslsk", "5c0744940b5c369b");
ssn = encryptor.encrypt(ssn);

to encrypt the social security number with the Spring security's classes.


FLAW 4:

Description

A7:2017 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

When the user inputs as the name the value

<script>alert("Hello!");</script>

in the last page the application runs the Javascript alert.

How to fix it

In the template done.html replace the attribute name

th:utext

with the

th:text

attribute name. The th:utext attribute is for the unescaped text and enables the XSS flaw.

  
FLAW 5:

Description

A9:2017 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

The command run

mvn dependency-check:check

resulted the KnownVulnerabilities.txt report about the components with the known vulnerabilities in the project. For example
the spring-security-core-4.1.3.RELEASE.jar has the vulnerabilities: BREACH attack possible in CSRF tokens, CVE-2016-9879, CVE-2018-1199, CVE-2018-1258. 

How to fix it

Replace the newest versions for all the dependencies in the pom.xml and after that run the mvn dependency-check:check again.
